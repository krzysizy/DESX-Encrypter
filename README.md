# DESX encrypter
DESX encrypter is a project for cryptography course at Technical University of Lodz. Project was about made an application to encrypt and decrypt files and text using DESX algorithm. Application has simple user interface. We implemented the whole algorithm on bitwise operations.
## Applications gives folliwing options:
- Generate radomly 3 uniqe 16-character keys
- Space to enter the text to be encrypted
- Shows encrypted text just after encryption
- Choosing file to to be encrypted and decrypted
- Choosing a place to save encrypted and decrypted files
